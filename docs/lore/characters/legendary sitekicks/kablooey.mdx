    ## Sitekick Remastered
    YTV used Kablooey in a handful of games. However, Sitekick Remastered uses Kablooey differently. Since Kablooey is Dr. Frantic's personal Sitekick, she would likely have the most features of any Sitekick.  Kablooey was the first Legendary Sitekick added to Sitekick Remastered.
