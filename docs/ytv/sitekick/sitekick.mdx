Sitekick (Legacy) was a [MMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game) designed for [YTV.com](/docs/ytv/) "YAP" members as a sort of an "online loyalty program" where members could customize their own robot character with [Chips](/docs/features/chips/) obtained from YTV.com, YTV broadcasting, [Woah! Magazine](/docs/ytv/whoa_magazine/), [Big Fun Party Mix](/docs/ytv/bfpm/) albums, and beyond.

Sitekick was released in late 2003 and [shut down in 2015](/docs/ytv/sitekick/sitekick_closure/) as browsers started phasing out support for Flash Player.
