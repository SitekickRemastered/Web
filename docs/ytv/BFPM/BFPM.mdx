# Big Fun Party Mix

Big Fun Party Mix is a series of compilation albums promoted by YTV.  These albums were released annually between 2000 and 2009, with an additional Christmas album, totaling 11 albums.

The compilations primarily featured pop and pop rock tracks popular during their respective release years.  While many songs were not directly affiliated with YTV, several were highlighted on YTV's music video show, The Hit List.  Big Fun Party Mix albums often included theme songs from programs airing on YTV at the time and typically concluded with a track by "Nuclear Donkey," a band formed by the hosts of YTV's The Zone.
