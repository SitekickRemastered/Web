# How to customize your Sitekick
Customizing your Sitekick is easy.  You can change your Sitekick's name, color, and equip chips.

## Changing your Sitekick's name
From the MAIN or CHIPS tab, select the top left menu, then select "Rename Sitekick".

## Changing your Sitekick's color
From the MAIN tab, select the top right paintbrush icon.

## Equipping chips
The CHIPS tab has a circular inventory typically referred to as equipment slots.  There are 8 slots that can hold chips.  Chips are layered starting at the top (12:00), going clockwise until 10:30.  When you place a chip in an equip slot, you must then click it again to equip it.
