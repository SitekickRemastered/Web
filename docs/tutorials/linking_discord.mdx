# Linking your account to Discord
You can link your Sitekick account to Discord to make safer trades with other members.  All members in the **#game-chat**, and **trading** forum have linked their accounts, which verifies their Sitekick identity.

To check someone's verification status, select them on Discord and look for the <span className="verifiedColour">**Verified**</span> role.

## How to link your own account

- Select the **#link** channel.
- Open Sitekick Remastered, open the top left menu, select **Link Discord**. Click **COPY**.

If you did it correctly, you should be renamed to your in-game name, be added to the <span className="verifiedColour">**Verified**</span> role, and gain access to **#game-chat** and **trade** forums.
