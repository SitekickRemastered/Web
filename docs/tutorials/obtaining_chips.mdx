# How to Get Chips
Chips are obtained through three different methods.  Chips are primarily spawned in the Chip Dump at the moment, but will transition to being obtained from different methods in the future.

## The Chip Dump
Select the "DUMP" button from the CHIPS screen.  Here you'll see freshly generated chips, alongside chips that other players have dumped.

## Chip Codes
From MAIN or CHIPS, select the top left menu, then "Enter Code".  Codes are given out for events, and can be distributed over Discord or Instagram.

## Trading
The TRADE tab lets you offer your own chips for chips that others have put up for trades.  You can add your own chips (max 4) to the yellow trade section on the CHIPS screen.  The number below the chip displays how many offers you have from other players.
