# The Dump

The Dump is a communal dumping ground for chips.  Don't have space for something?  Dump something.  Don't want something?  Dump it.  Players can see chips that other players dump in real time, and if they're fast enough they can obtain dumped chips before someone else, or before they despawn.

## During the Beta
During the Sitekick Remastered Beta, The Dump is being used to spawn chips.  Any Common, Rare, or Legendary chip can spawn at random within a defined spawn window.  Unique chips are only obtained via a [Secret Code](/docs/features/secret_code) or [Fusion](/docs/features/fusion).

Chips also despawn after a certain amount of time in the dump.  This feature will be removed in the full game.  Players can not extend the lifetime of a dumped chip unless they pick it up and dump it again.
