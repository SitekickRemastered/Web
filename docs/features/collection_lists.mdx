# Collection Lists

## Summary
Collection Lists are a returning feature from the original [YTV Sitekick](/docs/YTV/Sitekick/), with some small changes.  Collection lists are released daily, weekly, and monthly, as well as a few themed collections which have no expiry date.  Each chip collected grants 1XP to the player.



## Chip of the Day

</div>
The Chip of the Day is generated daily for every player, with a random chip selected for players to collect. While it may sometimes require an unreleased chip, this element of chance applies equally to all players, ensuring fairness in the long run. Over time, this system will naturally balance itself out. Like other lists, completing the Chip of the Day grants 1 XP, adding up to approximately 30 XP per month. This extra XP allows active players to climb the leaderboards faster than those who only log in for their monthly or weekly tasks.

## Chips of the Week

Chips of the week are generated at midnight on Sunday morning and last until the next Sunday morning.  Chips of the Week contain 2 common chips, 2 rare chips, and a legendary chip which are randomly generated.  Unlike the Chip of the Day, all players get the same Chips of the Week collections.

## Monthly Collection Lists

</div>
Monthly Colleciton Lists are generated at midnight on the 1st of every month.  They contain 5 common chips, 5 rare chips, and 5 legendary chips which are all randomly generated.  Similar to Chips of the Week, monthly lists are the same for all players.  However, unlike the Chip of the Day and Chips of the Week, monthly lists will be moved to a "Completed" state permanently if a player manages to complete it before it expires.  This allows players to see a list of all monthly collection lists they've completed in the past.

## Special Collection Lists

</div>
Special Collection Lists are curated by the development team based on a particular theme.  Special lists target having 5, 10, or 15 chips, but can have any number of chips.  These lists have no expiry date, which helps new players catch up in the ranks faster if they so choose.  Similar to monthly collection lists, special collections move to the Completed section if fully filled out.

## Legacy Collection Lists

[YTV Sitekick](/docs/YTV/Sitekick/) featured two types of collection lists: monthly and sponsored.  Monthly collection lists could be accessed for three months before they would become inaccessible.  It is assumed that sponsored lists would appear until a date negotiated by YTV/Corus and the advertiser.
