# Experience

## Summary

Experience points (typically known as XP or EXP) are a numerical representation of a player's progress.  Accumulating XP allows players to level up, unlock new features, customization options, and move up the leaderboards on SK-TV.  The top navigation menu will always display XP as a percentage to the next level, and a player's total experience is displayed in the info tab on SK-TV.

## Obtaining XP
XP is obtained by filling out Collection Lists.  Each chip collected is worth 1 XP.

Fusing chips will grant Experience at a later date.
