# Secret Code

## Summary
One method of [obtaining chips](/docs/tutorials/obtaining_chips) in Sitekick Remastered is by entering a Secret Code.  Players can open their left side menu, select "Enter Code", then enter a secret code if they have one.  If the code entered is valid, not expired or out of uses, a chip will appear.  The player can then collect or dump the chip.  The player must collect or dump the chip before another code can be used.

Players don't have to claim or dump a chip right away.  They can always come back to the Secret Code page again later when they've made up their mind.
