# Secret Code

{/*
  Returns the a checkmark or X icon depending on if a chip is active or not.
  
  You just have to pass active={true | false} depending on if the code is active
*/}
export function GetActive(props) {
  return (props.active) ? 
    <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-check" size="2x" style={{ color: "green" }} /> :

## Summary
One method of [obtaining chips](/docs/tutorials/obtaining_chips) in Sitekick Remastered is by entering a Secret Code.  Players can open their left side menu, select "Enter Code", then enter a secret code if they have one.  If the code entered is valid, not expired or out of uses, a chip will appear.  The player can then collect or dump the chip.  The player must collect or dump the chip before another code can be used.

Players don't have to claim or dump a chip right away.  They can always come back to the Secret Code page again later when they've made up their mind.

| Active | Chip | Code | Released |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|<GetActive active={true} /> | <ChipTableCell id={"0248"} name={"Spudkick"} /> | **PAUL** | 1/29/2024 |

{/* 
Adding a new line is pretty simple. Just copy the sample line below and fill out the data in order (Active, Chip, Code, Released). 
* GetActive should be either true or false
* ChipTableCell just needs the id and name to be specified as strings
* The other two cells must be filled manually

|<GetActive active={true} /> | <ChipTableCell id={"0248"} name={"Spudkick"} /> | **PAUL** | 1/29/2024 |

The Chip icons are pulled from `/img/wiki/chipendium/icons/` where I've placed all icons from the game. 
All you have to do is input a chip ID.  If it exists, it will show the icon image
