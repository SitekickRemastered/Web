# Secret Code

## Summary
One method of [obtaining chips](/docs/tutorials/obtaining_chips) in Sitekick Remastered is by entering a Secret Code.  Players can open their left side menu, select "Enter Code", then enter a secret code if they have one.  If the code entered is valid, not expired or out of uses, a chip will appear.  The player can then collect or dump the chip.  The player must collect or dump the chip before another code can be used.

Players don't have to claim or dump a chip right away.  They can always come back to the Secret Code page again later when they've made up their mind.

| Active | Icon | ID | Name | Code | Released |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-check" size="2x" style={{ color: "green" }} /> | ![chip_0248_icon.png](/img/wiki/chipendium/icons/chip_0248_icon.png) | 0248 | Spudkick | **PAUL** | 1/29/2024 |

Adding a new line is pretty simple.  Just copy one of these sample lines, fill out the data in order (Active, Icon, ID, Name, Code, Released).  

| <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-check" size="2x" style={{ color: "green" }} /> | ![chip_0248_icon.png](/img/wiki/chipendium/icons/chip_0248_icon.png) | 0248 | Spudkick | **PAUL** | 1/29/2024 |
| <FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark" size="2x" style={{ color: "e13238" }} /> | ![chip_0248_icon.png](/img/wiki/chipendium/icons/chip_0248_icon.png) | 0248 | Spudkick | **PAUL** | 1/29/2024 |

The first contains an active icon, and the second has an inactive icon.  They are otherwise exactly the same.

Active icon:
<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-check" size="2x" style={{ color: "green" }} />

Inactive icon:
<FAIcon icon="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark" size="2x" style={{ color: "e13238" }} />

The Chip icons are pulled from /img/wiki/chipendium/icons/ where I've placed all icons from the game.  All you have to do is input a chip ID.  If it exists, it will display:
