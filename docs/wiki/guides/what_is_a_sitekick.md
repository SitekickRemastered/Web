A Sitekick is your very own personal robot friend! Sitekicks run on things called ‘Chips’. By installing different Chips, you can do all sorts of cool things with your Sitekick – like customizing its appearance, trading with others, playing games and more. Chips are largely obtained through the Dump or by trade with other players, but more codes and alternate methods are planned for the future.

## Physiology
The Sitekick is typically round and yellow in colour, with a pair of shiny purple eyes. Its body seems to be composed of at least five pieces of metal. Its core is a black, bubbly liquid, also known as the Ooze.

It also possesses an antennae with a round ball on the top. When the ball is clicked, the antennae retracts before the SiteKick bursts its shell open to reveal its core. The core then reveals the Chips that were in the Sitekick. If the user clicks on one the Chips, and that Chip happens to be a Transformation Chip, it will trigger the transformation.
