You can link your Sitekick account to Discord to make safer trades with other members.  All members in the **#game-chat**, and **trading** forum have linked their accounts, which verifies their Sitekick identity.

To check someone's verification status, select them on Discord and look for the <span style="color:#4ae54a">**Verified**</span> role.

## How to link your own account
- [Join our Discord Server](https://discord.sitekickremastered.com/).  You may need to create an account if you do not already have one.
- Select the **#link** channel.
- Open Sitekick Remastered, open the top left menu, select **Link Discord**. Click **COPY**.
- Go back to Discord.  Type /link, and paste your code, and press enter.  Example: ```/link DZOXOV```

If you did it correctly, you should be renamed to your in-game name, be added to the <span style="color:#4ae54a">**Verified**</span> role, and gain access to **#game-chat** and **trade** forums.
