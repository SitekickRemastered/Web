"Whoa! Magazine" was a Canadian publication tied to YTV, first launched in 1999. It focused on TV shows, music, and video games, featuring interviews, quizzes, and articles for a younger audience. The magazine began as a print publication and later transitioned into an online format in 2007. Though it ended in 2011, it remains a memorable piece of YTV's history. A brief French edition, Whao, was also released. The magazine's legacy continues through archived issues, many of which are still difficult to find.
