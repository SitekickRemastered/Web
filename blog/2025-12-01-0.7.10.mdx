After a couple of very busy months, we're happy to finally release **0.7.10**!

Like 0.7.9, this update includes a lot of patches

### Beta Version 0.7.10

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed lag when collecting a chip from the dump
- Chipendium details works properly outside of the CHIPS tab
    - Note: Rarity only appears if 25,000 chips are in the game - otherwise it will show '???'
- Deleting an account now wipes player chipendium details
    - Delete accounts no longer appear in "Discovered by"
- Dumped chips are now removed from the trade tab
- Fixed XP bar darkening with chip of the day popup
- Special dialogs no longer appear on alt accounts
- Using the "Rename Sitekick" popup without changing the name no longer sends a server call
- Fixed the sidebar menu sound so it only plays when it is closed manually
- Fixed outside click events for popups
    - Popups now close when the faded area is tapped

### Known Issues
- Chipendium details is still a little slow, and will break if buttons are spammed
- XP bar disappears when opening the collection lists menu
