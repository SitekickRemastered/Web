WOAH! Updates? Here? Happy Soon™️ day!

**Version 0.6.0 is here.**<br />
<!-- truncate-->
Version 0.6.0 is our largest update to date. With this version, we enter an open beta. All players can register without submitting an application. The game is in a stable enough state to be public.

**NOTE:** Sitekick Remastered is still in Beta. All chips, xp, and collection lists will be wiped upon the full release.

**What's new:**<br />
- 600+ new chips<br />
- The Chipendium now logs every chip you pick up<br />
- You can now trade between players<br />
- Password resets now function<br />
- Account verification emails now function<br />
- 10 new slots (see bugs)<br />

**Major changes:**<br />
Playing via a web browser is no longer supported. The only supported platforms currently are Android and Windows.

**Known bugs:**<br />
- All equipped chips were moved to player inventories (+10 slots)<br />
- Dumping a chip up for trade doesn't cancel the offer (it can not be accepted)<br />
- Some players might need to re-launch the game to see new trade offers<br />
