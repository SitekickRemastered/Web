Hello! Pretty major announcement for you all:

We've decided to make the majority of our code open source. Right now, you'll be able to see the code from our Wiki and Discord bots.

We also plan to release our code for the game client and game server at a later date (with a few exclusions).

All of our public repositories are hosted on Github

Our kanban board is found here

Today we also released an update for SitePic that adds presets for Authicer, Kablooey, Paul, and deadkick (deactivated Sitekick). Check them out in the help menu.
