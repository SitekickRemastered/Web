Hey Mac & Emulator Users!

It appears that moving to Google Play broke the game for people who played via emulator. 

You can now find a new button on the play page that allows you to download Sitekick's Android APK, perfect for sideloading onto an Android Emulator.

Please note that we don't have immediate plans to support Apple devices, but this should provide an alternative for our Mac users.
