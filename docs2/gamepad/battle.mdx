## Game Mechanics
- **Rounds:** Matches consist of up to five rounds. Each round, players select a Chip, then watch an animated outcome. 
- **Status Bars:** Players manage three key stats:
  - **Energy**: Represents health points. Starts full at the beginning of each match.
  - **Moxie**: Represents style points. Starts empty and fills throughout the match.
  - **Power Points**: Determines how many Chips a player can use. Players start with a full meter, and gaining Battle Levels increases their maximum Power Points.

## Winning Conditions
- **Energy KO:** Completely drain the opponentâ€™s Energy bar within five rounds.
- **Moxie KO:** Completely fill your Moxie bar within five rounds.
- **Match Win:** If no KO occurs, the player with the highest combined Energy and Moxie score wins.
- **Default Win:** A disconnected opponent results in an automatic win.

## Gameplay Features
- **Upper Hand:** Determines which player's animation appears first, giving a strategic advantage. The player who accepts a Battle challenge starts with the Upper Hand by default, but certain Chips can change this.
- **Dead Chips:** Once a Chip is used, it becomes "dead" and cannot be played again in the same match unless revived by special effects.

## Progression System
- **Battle Experience (BXP):** Earned after each match, regardless of the outcome. BXP determines Battle Levels.
- **Battle Level:** Higher Battle Levels allow for more Power Points in a match. The maximum Battle Level is **50**.
- **Battle Rank:** Based on the **ELO chess system**, Battle Rank is an invisible score that determines leaderboard placement. Winning against stronger opponents boosts this score significantly.
