        <Heading as="h2" id="legalBases">3. What Legal Bases Do We Rely On To Process Your Personal Information?</Heading>
        <p><i><b>In Short:</b> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</i></p>
        <p><b><i><u>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</u></i></b></p>
        <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, such as participating in the Forum, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent).

        <ul>
          <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>

          <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>

          <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
          <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
          <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
          <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
          <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
          <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>

        <Heading as="h2" id="cookies">5. Do We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?</Heading>
        <p><i><b>In Short:</b> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</i></p>

        <br />
        <Heading as="h2" id="infoRetain">6. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</Heading>
        <p><i><b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</i></p>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information, such as account details and Forum profile information, for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us. However, Forum posts you create may be retained indefinitely, even after account deletion, as they are considered public contributions to the Services.</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

        <br />
        <Heading as="h2" id="infoSafe">7. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</Heading>
        <p><i><b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</i></p>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services, including the Forum, is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

        <Heading as="h4">Account Information</Heading>
        <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can contact us using the contact information <Link to="#contact">provided on this website and within this document</Link>.

        <Heading as="h2" id="DNT">9. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</Heading>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
